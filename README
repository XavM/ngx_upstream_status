nginx upstream status
=====================

This module provides a handler called upstream_status that can be used as follows:

location /foo {
	upstream_status;
}


It reports all the upstream blocks configured for this server. For upstreams managed using the round robin (default upstream), it lists all the servers configured in a block and indicates the current status (up/down)
